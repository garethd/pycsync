A simple python picasaweb to hard drive picture downloader.
Also does resizing to help limit disk usage. 
This is pretty nifty with slideshow type screensavers. 


Depends on Python and Google's data protocol Python API (Gdata).

Python:
| version | tested
--------------------------
| 2.5     | no
| 2.6     | yes
| 2.7     | no
| 3.x     | no
--------------------------

Untested versions along 2.x should work anyway.

Gdata:

http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client

Tested using gdata-python-client version 2.0.14.
